# S3 Deployment Guide for Doctor Procedures React App

## üéØ Overview
This guide will help you deploy your React app to Amazon S3 for static website hosting. Your app will be accessible via a public URL and ready for testing.

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. AWS CLI Setup
```bash
# Install AWS CLI (if not already installed)
brew install awscli  # macOS
# or download from: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter your:
# - AWS Access Key ID
# - AWS Secret Access Key  
# - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# - Default output format (json)
```

### 2. Build Your App
```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Edit the bucket name in deploy-to-s3.sh if needed
# Then run:
./deploy-to-s3.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Create S3 bucket
aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name --region us-east-1

# 2. Enable static website hosting
aws s3 website s3://your-bucket-name --index-document index.html --error-document index.html

# 3. Upload files
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete

# 4. Set public read permissions
aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name --policy '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Option 3: AWS Amplify (Advanced)
For a more robust solution with CI/CD:
```bash
# Install Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

# Initialize Amplify project
amplify init

# Add hosting
amplify add hosting

# Deploy
amplify publish
```

## üåê Accessing Your App

After deployment, your app will be available at:
- **S3 Website URL**: `http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- **Direct S3 URL**: `https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html`

## üîß Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables
Your React app is built with these settings:
- API Base URL: `https://jj6skt98b3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- Bedrock Agent ID: `EBGEJR3FWL`

### CORS Considerations
If you encounter CORS issues, ensure your API Gateway has the correct CORS headers:
```json
{
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"
}
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **403 Forbidden Error**
   - Check bucket policy allows public read access
   - Verify bucket name in policy matches actual bucket

2. **404 on Refresh**
   - S3 static hosting uses `index.html` as error document for SPA routing
   - This is already configured in the deployment script

3. **API Calls Failing**
   - Check if your AWS Lambda functions are in the same region
   - Verify API Gateway endpoints are publicly accessible
   - Check browser developer tools for CORS errors

4. **Build Errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check for any linting errors in the code

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployed app:
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Rebuild
npm run build

# 3. Redeploy
./deploy-to-s3.sh
```

## üí° Production Considerations

For production use, consider:
- **CloudFront**: Add CDN for better performance and HTTPS
- **Custom Domain**: Use Route 53 for custom domain names
- **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch for logging and metrics
- **Security**: Review bucket policies and access controls

## üì± Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:
1. ‚úÖ Chat interface loads and connects to Bedrock Agent
2. ‚úÖ Quick Actions forms work (Add Procedure, Get Quote, Show History)
3. ‚úÖ Error handling displays correctly
4. ‚úÖ Responsive design works on mobile devices
5. ‚úÖ All API calls to your Lambda functions succeed

Your Doctor Procedures app should now be live and ready for testing!
